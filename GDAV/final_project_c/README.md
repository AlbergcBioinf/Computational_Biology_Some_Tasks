## Project Description

Your lab has identified an interesting effect in a hot spring located in Iceland: 

Coinciding with the activity of a nearby volcano, the hot spring undergoes events of very high temperature. You noticed that, after such episodes of high temperature (close to 90 degrees!), a bloom of algae living in the same environment happens. 

You wrote a research grant proposing to investigate this effect and, lucky you!, you received a very generous funding from Tyrell Corporation. Your grant proposed to perform an in depth genomic and metagenomic exploration of this singular hot spring ecosystem, which involved eight work packages: 

1. Metagenomic analysis
2. RNA-seq samples and read mapping
3. Variant calling
4. Differential expression analysis
5. Functional analysis 
6. Phylogenetic analysis 
7. Conclusions

This repository organizes different analyses of deep genomic and metagenomic exploration within various directories:

1. **Metagenomic Analysis**: Located within the `Metagenomics` directory.
   
2. **RNA-seq Samples and Read Mapping**: Conducted in the `RNAseq` directory.
   
3. **Variant Calling**: The process of variant calling is performed within the `variantCalling` directory.
   
4. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Executed in the `DEA` directory.
   
5. **Functional Analysis**: For functional analysis, navigate to the `cfa` directory.
   
6. **Phylogenetic Analysis**: The phylogenetic analysis is conducted within the `PhyloCompaAnalysis` directory.
