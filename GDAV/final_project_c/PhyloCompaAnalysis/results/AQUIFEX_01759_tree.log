Host:    gdav (SSE3, 31 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s ../results/AQUIFEX_01759_aligned.fasta -m LG -pre ../results/AQUIFEX_01759_tree --fast
Seed:    466068 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon Jan 29 18:10:19 2024
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (16 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 16 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
